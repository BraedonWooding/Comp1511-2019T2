# Final Week!!!!

Feedback time.

## Assignment?

I'm going to go over how to look at advance enemies

## What is a header file / implementation file

Including a real world example :O!

Let's say we have 3 files; `list.h`, `list.c` and `main.c` how would I include the list in `main.c` and how would I compile it all?

## What is a queue and what is a stack

Diagram time

## Your time to choose.

Either we write a queue/stack or we do some exam questions or go over assignment.
